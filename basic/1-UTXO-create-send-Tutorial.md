### **Tutorial 1**: Learn UTXO model, create a wallet address and send minimas between nodes(wallets)
-----------------------------------------------------------
- 1: **Execute** on the terminal console ` newaddress ` copy the **"address"** the terminal prompts, and this will be your wallet address for receiving minimas or tokens.
- 2: **Send** minimas only : `send address: (the wallet address of other node)  amount:1 ` .
- 3: **_amount_**  is the quantity of minmas to send, it can be 0.000001 if you want , until 44 decimals.
- 4: **Check** your balance with the command: ` balance ` if you received some minimas or tokens it should prompt it to the terminal.
- 5: **Check** UTXO how it works, send 0.2 minimas two times one after one and you will see that you have no funds, that is becouse of how UTXO works, until the destination address dosen't receive the coins and send you back the change, you cannot use it becouse you don't have it, as it has been sent to the destination address.
------------------------------------------------------------
##### Ask for 1 minima on minima discord "#app-chat" channel and someone DM you and ask for your address to send 1 minima, once finished the tutorial, do the same to help other people to learn, that's the minima community philosophy, help each other.
